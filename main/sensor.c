/* Segments per run (PLAN_4NODE Phase 1 + 5).
 *
 * Phase 5 made the run length the *display* window: the Focus panel holds a
 * target for exactly as long as its bits are collected, so the hold time is not
 * a delay bolted onto a run — it IS the run. Padding with a vTaskDelay would
 * cut the bit rate for nothing.
 *
 * **ONE window for every focus display: 1000 ms** (user decision, 2026-07-25).
 * The spec originally asked for 1000 ms per candidate number and 500 ms per
 * draw; the 500 ms was dropped so that anything the observer is asked to attend
 * to gets the same, longer look. That collapses what was briefly a
 * phase-dependent count back to one constant per source — scoring, measurement
 * and baseline all run the same length — and the two "SCORE/MEAS" pairs are
 * gone with it. The *wire* still carries the count (see slave_trigger), which
 * stays worthwhile: it is what makes the length impossible for a node to get
 * wrong, whether or not it currently varies.
 *
 * The camera counts are CALIBRATED ON HARDWARE, not derived on paper — the
 * Phase 5 gate insists on that, and the paper answer was wrong by 60 %.
 *
 * What makes the paper answer wrong is that the sustained rate is not a
 * constant: the measurement loop runs one priority ABOVE the camera extraction
 * task it consumes from, so the harder it consumes the more it starves its own
 * producer. Measured on the live 4-node array (2026-07-25, all four on camera,
 * a client polling /focus at 10 Hz), per-cycle sustained rate against duty
 * cycle (run / (run + gap)):
 *
 *      n=6350   run  277 ms   duty 57 %   2.63 Mbit/s
 *      n=11600  run  588 ms   duty 72 %   2.82 Mbit/s
 *      n=17000  run 1519 ms   duty 88 %   1.98 Mbit/s   <- collapsed
 *
 * So it is flat near 2.7 Mbit/s and falls off a cliff somewhere past ~72 %, at
 * which point longer runs feed back into a slower producer and get longer
 * still. None of this is visible in Phase 0's 3.49 Mbit/s idle figure. The
 * counts below are solved from the flat part — n = rate × (window + gap) —
 * which also keeps the source out of the starved regime, where PLAN_4NODE's
 * open item 3 (camera bias degrading under sustained load) lives.
 *
 * This is the other reason RUN_GAP_MS is not merely cosmetic: the gap is when
 * the producer gets the CPU back, so it buys back most of what it costs.
 *
 * z stays N(0,1) at any run length because it is normalised by √segments; the
 * length only sets granularity, and statistical power per second is
 * rate-limited either way. */

 *
 * Why longer at all: the observer is meant to hold one number in attention, and
 * a 1 s presentation is barely time to arrive at it. Why one long run rather
 * than three short ones (which is what this replaces): repeating a target back
 * to back means the second and third windows have no onset, and onset is the
 * payload — the operator asked specifically to avoid an immediately repeated
 * target. Statistically the two are the SAME thing: one 3 s run is
 * Σdeviations/√(3N), which is exactly the Stouffer combination of three 1 s
 * runs. Nothing is gained or lost in the arithmetic; what changes is that the

 *
 * ⚠ THE GAP HAS TO GROW WITH IT — see SCORE_GAP_MS in focus.h. Duty cycle, not
 * window length, is what starves the extraction task, and 3 s against the

 * tuned to and into the regime where the achievable window stretches instead of
 * obeying the count.
